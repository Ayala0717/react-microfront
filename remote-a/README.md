# Vite + React microfront

This is an example from a microfrontend, using [Federation Plugin](https://github.com/originjs/vite-plugin-federation/tree/main)
In this folder, just run `[npm | yarn | pnpm] run build` and `[npm | yarn | pnpm] run preview`, this going to up a server as prod mode in the port 5001
