# Vite + React microfront

This is an example from a microfrontend, using [Federation Plugin](https://github.com/originjs/vite-plugin-federation/tree/main)
	
To use, run `nvs use` or set node version in `20.11.1`

Run `[npm | yarn | pnpm] run install` in root folder, do the same in the `micro-front`, `remote-a` and `remote-b` folders.

For `micro-front`, `remote-a` and `remote-b` folders, run `[npm | yarn | pnpm] run build`, and for `remote-a` and `remote-b` run `[npm | yarn | pnpm] run preview` (this run a server as prod mode); for `micro-front` just run `[npm | yarn | pnpm] run dev`
